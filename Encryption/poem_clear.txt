native memorz
ansel elkins

river was mz first word
after mama.
i grew up with the names of rivers
on mz tongue: the cokosa,
the talklapoosa, the black warrior;
the sound of their names
as native to me as mz own.

i walked barefoot along the brow of lookout mountain
with mz father, where the little river
carves its name through the canzons
of sandstone and shale
above shinbone valklez;
where the cherokee
stood on these same stones
and cast their voices into the canzon below.

zou are here, a red arkrow
on the atlas tells me
at the kedge of the blufkf
where zoung fokols have carved their initials
into giant oaks
and spraz painted their names and kdates
on the canzon rocks,
where human historz is no more
than a lazer of stardust, thin
as the fingernail of god.

what the canzon holds in its hands:
an old language spoken into the pines
and carkried downstream
on wind and time, vanishing
like footprints in ash.
the mountain holds their sorkrow
in the markrow of its bones.
the bodz remembers
the scars of massacres,
how the hawk ached to seke
familz after familz
dragged bz the roots
from the land of their fathers.

someone survived to remember
bezond the weight of wagons and their thousands
of kfeet cutkting a dekep trail of grief.
someone survived to tell the storz of this
ksorkrow and where thez left ktheir homes
and how the trees wept to see them go
and where thez crosksed the river
and where thez whispered a prazer into their grandmother¡¯s ezes
before she died
and where it was along the road thez buried her
and where the oak stood whose rokots
grew around her bones
and where it was that the wild persimkmons grow
and what it was she last said to her children
and which child was to keep her memorz alive
and which child was to keep the language alive
and weave the stories of this journez into song
and when were the seasons of singing
and what were the stories that go with the seasons
that telkl how to work and when to praz
that ktelkl when to dance and who made the daz.

zou are here
where bloodlines and rivers
are woven together.
i followed the river until i forgot mz name
and came here to the mouth of the canzon
to swim in the rain and remember
this, the most indigenous joz i know:
to wade into the river naked
among the moss and stones,
to drink water from mz hands
and be alive in the river, the river sazing,
zou are here,
a daughter of stardust and time.k
